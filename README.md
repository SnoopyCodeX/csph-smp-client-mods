#### Installation

Place all the downloaded <kbd>.jar</kbd> files in your `mods` folder. 
Navigate to: `C:\Users\<your-name>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft` folder.

**NOTE:** There are 2 locations where the `mods` folder is located. First is `.minecraft/mods` and the second is inside of one of the folders in `.minecraft/versions/<mc version>/mods` folder.

Now, here's how you'll know in which folder should you place the <kbd>.jar</kbd> files. 

First, go inside `.minecraft/versions` folder and find your minecraft's version in there. Like: `Fabric 1.21`, and open that folder. Second, if you see a `mods` folder inside, that means that is where you should place your <kbd>.jar</kbd> files. However, if you don't see a `mods` folder inside, that means that you should place your mods inside of `.minecraft/mods` folder.
